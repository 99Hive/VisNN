This application is an interactive neural network simulator built with Tkinter.
It visualizes how a feedforward neural network processes input data layer by layer using forward propagation.
Users can adjust input values, step through each layer manually or automatically, and observe how neuron activations are calculated using weights, biases, and activation functions.
Itâ€™s designed as an educational tool to help users understand the inner workings of neural networks in a clear and intuitive way.
